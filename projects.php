          <h5 class="card-title">DATABASE ACCESS CONTROL (DACOS)</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Database Access Control System (D.A.C.O.S) is designed to manage database access. To guarantee that only authorized users 
can access the database, the system will be implementing Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control 
(MAC). Both access controls are implemented to maintain confidentiality and integrity. This system is developed using the 
Tree Methodology and Visual Basic. There are two types of users for this system: administrator and staff. The administrator 
is responsible for managing user permission, monitoring system performance, troubleshooting issues, and doing backup and 
recovery. Meanwhile, the staff will be doing their task based on RBAC and MAC assigned to them. A significant contribution 
is to help management by providing robust database access control mechanisms for businesses and organizations</p>
